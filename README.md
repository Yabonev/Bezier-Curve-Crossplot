# Bezier-Curve-Crossplot
## Simple interactive JavaScript project for creating custom n-th dimension Bezier Curve and its coordinate functions

### --------------CONTROLS--------------------
0. Interaction is possibly only in ####__I__#### quadrant.
1. **Left Mouse Button** creates a *point* for the *control polygon* of the Bezier curve.
2. **Spacebar** computes and draws the *Bezier curve* in the __I__ quadrant
and the coordinate functions(also *Bezier curves*) in the __II__ and __IV__ quadrant, which **halts** interaction with the canvas
3. **ESC** resets the canvas and resumes intercation with the canvas

*--Actual implementation code with comments is in the **js** file--*
